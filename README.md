BEWARE, HERE BE DRAGONS 

This is an old university project i've made for web design, while most of the page works as intended, it has a few bugs that I didnt had (Nor will I ever have) time to fix, it is full of ugly hacks to make it work, and it IS NOT functional,
but rather tries to replicate what it would look like as a functional, real, web page. 

Not much else to say, this readme isn't even well done, and I'll not dedicate more time to this project, I've already passed the exam years ago, no will or need to update this with new acquired knowledge and skills of mine.

This probably wont work at all if ran locally outside of gitpages, after all, all the ugly hacks were made to make this work on gitpages specifically.
